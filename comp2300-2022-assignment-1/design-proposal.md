- Words:  
I am planning to show "Beginner", "Advanced", "Expert" and "END" on my microbit. I will show the letters one by one.
- Arrows:  
Two opposite directions arrows in one group. Group 1 is an arrow from right to left and another arrow from left to right. Group 2 is an arrow from the bottom to the top and another arrow is from top to bottom. These two opposite arrows in the same group will not be present at the same time. When one arrow goes to the end of the edge, another arrow will start to move.
- Math Questions:  
I am planning to show the math questions by using the microbit. e.g. "1 + 2 = ?", the question mark will blink three times. The answer will present after that. I will show the numbers and notations one by one. 

There are three similar loops in the show. At first, the Words will be present on the screen. Then the Arrows in Group 1 will come up. After that, the Math Questions will present. Finally, the Arrows in Group 2 will show on the screen and then back to the first step (show the Words). When the third loop is finished, "END" will come up after the arrows.
